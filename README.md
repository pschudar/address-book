The default login information is "Demo" for the user, case sensitive. "demoPass1#" is the password. Once you're logged in, edit your password immediately.

By default, the password requirements are: Must be at least 5 characters in length, contain 1 upper and 1 lower case letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol (#, $, %, ^ etc).
