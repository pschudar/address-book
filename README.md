# address-book
An elegantly simple but powerful address book application written in PHP7, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and utilizing W3.CSS framework. I am an avid fan of Bootstrap, however, it's quite heavy. For a demo script like this, I felt it was entirely too much.

# Installation
Open adddress_book.sql in your favorite text editor. Copy the contents of the file and run through PHPMyAdmin.

Upload all files to your public directory (public_html, htdocs, etc) into a directory called 'address_book'

The default login information is "Demo" for the user, case sensitive. "Demopass1#" is the password. Once you're logged in, edit your password immediately.

By default, the password requirements are: Must be at least 5 characters in length, contain 1 upper and 1 lower case letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol (#, $, %, ^ etc).

The project is still being developed. It is not recommended that it be used in a production server.
